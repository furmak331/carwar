🚗💨 Welcome to CarWar: Where Wheels Wage War on Boredom! 🏁
***Decrypt this:
Qe'er abg whfg ersragrq gb tnzr bs guebarf, ohg jr qb unir n "Tnzr bs Ebnqf!"

Our fleet:

🚀 Turbo Turtles (for when you want to win by a hare)
🦄 Unicorn Ubers (mythically clean, magically mean)
🕴️ Secret Agent Sedans (comes with complimentary sunglasses and suspicious briefcase)
🎭 Drama Llama Limos (for when you need to arrive... dramatically)

Remember, in the game of CarWar, you either drive or you walk. Choose wisely, and may the g-force be with you!
P.S. No cars were harmed in the making of this website. They were, however, mildly inconvenienced and slightly bemused.




***Translation:
We're not just referent to game of thrones, but we do have a "Game of Roads!"
Are you tired of pedestrian transportation options? Sick of your feet touching the ground like some kind of bipedal pleb? Well, strap in, because CarWar is about to elevate your ground game!
